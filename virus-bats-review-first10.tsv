 PCR-positive, and none of the PCR-positive animals IgG-positive; opposite seasonal trends in PCR and serological Ebola detection results; findings support results of
 previous investigations that identify bats as candidate reservoirs for Ebola and Marburg viruses, and as reservoirs for the virus families Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae,
 which are genetically related to Ebola; seasonal patterns of transmission risk assumed; traps and nets checked each morning

This difference could be due to a higher circulation of MARV between the bats living in the caves. Similarly, a high MARV-specific IgG prevalence rate
(about 20%) has been reported in DRC in a cave-captured population of R. aegyptiacus [14]. Together, these findings point to the existence of two different ecological biotopes  for Marburg and Ebola viruses: one linked to bats roosting in caves (Rousettus or Microchiroptera species) and the
other linked to bats roosting in trees in the open forest.
